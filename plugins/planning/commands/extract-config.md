**Arguments**: None required

Goal: Extract comprehensive roadmap/project.json, roadmap/features.json, roadmap/application-design.json, and roadmap/website-design.json from all generated architecture documentation with full context.

Core Principles:
- Read ALL architecture docs before generating config
- Cross-reference for completeness and consistency
- Extract tech stack from multiple sources (backend.md, frontend.md, data.md, ai.md, infrastructure.md)
- Extract features from ROADMAP.md and architecture analysis
- Extract application pages (Next.js) and website pages (Astro) from frontend.md
- Generate comprehensive configuration files ready for init-project

      }
    },
    "extracted_at": "2025-01-XX",
    "extracted_from": "architecture docs via /planning:extract-config"
  }
  ```
- Write to roadmap/project.json
- Validate JSON syntax
- Update todos

Phase 5: Extract Features (features.json)
Goal: Generate comprehensive roadmap/features.json from ROADMAP.md and architecture

Actions:
- Parse ROADMAP.md for feature list:
  - Feature names and descriptions

  - Dependencies between features
  - Estimated effort
- Cross-reference with architecture docs for feature details:
  - ai.md for AI-related features
  - frontend.md for UI features
  - backend.md for API features
  - data.md for data features
- Extract shared context from architecture:
  - Tech stack references
  - Common dependencies
  - Infrastructure requirements
- **CRITICAL: Analyze feature dependencies and determine build order**:
  - Infrastructure must come first (always dependency for features)
  - Foundation features before dependent features
  - Core services before UI features
  - Data models before features using them
  - API endpoints before frontend consuming them
- Number features sequentially (F001, F002, etc.)
- **Order features by build_order (not just priority)**
- Group features by priority AND dependencies
- Update todos

Phase 6: Generate features.json
Goal: Write comprehensive roadmap/features.json with dependency-based ordering

Actions:
- Generate features.json with structure:
  ```json
  {
    "features": [
      {
        "id": "F001",
        "name": "Feature Name",
        "description": "Detailed description from ROADMAP and architecture",
        "priority": "P0",
        "status": "not_started",
        "estimated_effort": "3-5 days",
        "build_order": 1,
        "dependencies": ["infrastructure"],
        "blocks": ["F003", "F005"],
        "architecture_refs": [
          "docs/architecture/ai.md#rag-system",
          "docs/architecture/backend.md#api-endpoints"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "build_order_explanation": {
      "1": "Foundation features (no feature dependencies, only infrastructure)",
      "2": "Core services (depend on foundation)",
      "3": "Secondary features (depend on core services)",
      "4": "UI features (depend on backend/core services)",
      "5": "Integration features (depend on multiple features)"
    },
    "shared_context": {
      "tech_stack": "Next.js 15 + FastAPI + Supabase",
      "ai_stack": "Claude Agent SDK + Vercel AI SDK",
      "authentication": "Clerk with Supabase RLS",
      "deployment": "Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)"
    },
    "extracted_at": "2025-01-XX",
    "extracted_from": "ROADMAP.md + architecture docs via /planning:extract-config"
  }
  ```
- **CRITICAL: Features MUST be ordered by build_order in the array**
  - Feature with build_order: 1 comes first
  - Features with same build_order can be built in parallel
  - This ensures /planning:init-project creates specs in correct order
