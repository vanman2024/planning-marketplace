## Security Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All generated files must follow security rules:

@docs/security/SECURITY-RULES.md

**Key requirements:**
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use placeholders: `your_service_key_here`
- Protect `.env` files with `.gitignore`
- Create `.env.example` with placeholders only
- Document key acquisition for users

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

Goal: Rapidly generate complete project specifications from features.json (or massive project description if features.json missing)

Core Principles:
- **Prefer features.json if it exists** (source of truth)
- Read project.json for tech stack context
- Generate specs ONLY for features without specs/ directories
- Process 3-5 features at a time (batching)
- Use structured JSON to coordinate agents
- Provide comprehensive summary with paths

Phase 0: Check Existing Project Data
Goal: Check if features.json and project.json already exist

Actions:
- Check for features.json: !{bash test -f roadmap/features.json && echo "✅ EXISTS" || echo "⚠️ MISSING"}
- Check for project.json: !{bash test -f roadmap/project.json && echo "✅ EXISTS" || echo "⚠️ MISSING"}

**If BOTH exist**:
  - Read features.json: @roadmap/features.json
  - Read project.json: @roadmap/project.json
  - Extract feature list from features.json
  - Check which features already have specs (phase-nested or legacy):
    !{bash for f in $(jq -r '.features | keys[]' roadmap/features.json 2>/dev/null); do phase=$(jq -r ".features[\"$f\"].phase // 0" roadmap/features.json); if [ -d "specs/phase-$phase/$f-"* ] || [ -d "specs/$f" ]; then echo "$f: ✅ HAS SPEC"; else echo "$f: ⚠️ NEEDS SPEC"; fi; done}
  - Filter to features WITHOUT specs
  - Display: "Found [X] features, [Y] need specs"
  - **SKIP to Phase 4** (use existing roadmap/features.json)

**If roadmap/features.json MISSING**:
  - Display: "roadmap/features.json not found - will create from architecture docs"
  - Continue to Phase 1 (architecture analysis)

Phase 1: Verify Architecture Documentation
Goal: Check for architecture docs created by /planning:architecture, /planning:decide, /planning:roadmap

Actions:
- Check if architecture docs exist: !{bash test -d docs/architecture && echo "✅ Found" || echo "⚠️ Missing"}
- If docs/architecture/ exists:
  - List architecture files: !{bash ls -1 docs/architecture/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l}
  - List ADR files: !{bash ls -1 docs/adr/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l}
  - Verify ROADMAP: !{bash test -f docs/ROADMAP.md && echo "✅ Found" || echo "⚠️ Missing"}
  - Architecture files will be passed directly to agents via @ references:
    - @docs/architecture/frontend.md
    - @docs/architecture/backend.md
    - @docs/architecture/data.md
    - @docs/architecture/ai.md
    - @docs/architecture/infrastructure.md
    - @docs/architecture/security.md
    - @docs/architecture/integrations.md
    - @docs/adr/*.md
    - @docs/ROADMAP.md
- If not exists:
  - Note: Will use $ARGUMENTS only (architecture docs recommended)
- No temporary files needed

Phase 2: Parse Project Description
Goal: Save the project description and validate input

Actions:
- Parse $ARGUMENTS to extract project description
- Save description to temporary file for analysis
- Example: !{bash echo "$ARGUMENTS" > /tmp/project-description.txt}
- Verify description is substantial (>100 words) OR architecture docs exist
- Count words: !{bash wc -w < /tmp/project-description.txt}

Phase 3: Feature Analysis
Goal: Break massive description into discrete features with dependencies

Actions:

Task(description="Analyze architecture and break into features", subagent_type="planning:feature-analyzer", prompt="You are the feature-analyzer agent.

INPUT SOURCES:

Architecture Documentation (read directly from source):
@docs/architecture/frontend.md
@docs/architecture/backend.md
@docs/architecture/data.md
@docs/architecture/ai.md
@docs/architecture/infrastructure.md
@docs/architecture/security.md
@docs/architecture/integrations.md
@docs/adr/*.md
@docs/ROADMAP.md

Project Description: $ARGUMENTS

YOUR TASK:
Break this into AS MANY focused features as needed. NO ARTIFICIAL LIMITS.

CRITICAL: Each feature should be:
- Implementable in 2-3 days (if >3 days, SPLIT IT)
- Result in 200-300 line specs (NOT 647!)
- Have 15-25 tasks (NOT 45!)
- Single responsibility
- Reference architecture docs for details (don't duplicate)

SIZING RULE: If a feature needs >3 days or >25 tasks, it's TOO LARGE - split it.

Example: DON'T create large features like 'User Authentication'
Instead, create focused features:
- Feature 1: Basic Auth (email/password) - 2 days, 18 tasks
- Feature 2: OAuth Integration - 2 days, 15 tasks
- Feature 3: MFA - 1 day, 12 tasks
- Feature 4: Password Reset - 1 day, 10 tasks

The project might have 10 features, 50 features, or 200 features - THAT'S OK.
What matters: Each feature is small, focused, and implementable in 2-3 days.

Deliverable: JSON output with:
- features array (AS MANY AS NEEDED - no artificial limit):
  - number, name, shortName, focus
  - dependencies (feature numbers this depends on)
  - estimatedDays (2-3 typical, MAX 3)
  - complexity (low/medium/high)
  - architectureReferences (which docs/architecture/*.md sections to reference)
- sharedContext (techStack, userTypes, dataEntities, integrations)

Save JSON to: /tmp/feature-breakdown.json")

Wait for feature-analyzer to complete and generate JSON.

Phase 4: Prepare Feature List for Spec Generation
Goal: Get final list of features that need specs (from roadmap/features.json OR feature-breakdown.json)

Actions:
**If came from Phase 0** (roadmap/features.json exists):
  - Features list already loaded from roadmap/features.json
  - Filter to features WITHOUT specs/ directories (from Phase 0)
  - Use roadmap/project.json for tech stack context
  - Display: "Generating specs for [X] features from roadmap/features.json"

**If came from Phase 3** (created feature-breakdown.json):
  - Load the generated JSON: @/tmp/feature-breakdown.json
  - Extract feature list from JSON
  - Count total features: !{bash jq '.features | length' /tmp/feature-breakdown.json}
  - Display feature list for user visibility
  - Example: !{bash jq -r '.features[] | "\(.number) - \(.name): \(.focus)"' /tmp/feature-breakdown.json}
  - Display: "Generating specs for [X] features from architecture analysis"

**Batching Strategy**:
  - Total features to generate: [X]
  - Batch size: 3-5 features at a time
  - Number of batches: [X/5 rounded up]
  - Display: "Will generate in [Y] batches of 3-5 features"

Phase 5: Parallel Spec Generation (Batch 1)
Goal: Generate specs for first 3-5 features in parallel

Actions:
- Select first 3-5 features from list (features without specs)
- Display: "Batch 1: Generating specs for features [F001, F002, F003...]"

**Data Sources for Spec Writer**:
- If from features.json: Use feature data from features.json + project.json for tech stack
- If from feature-breakdown.json: Use feature data from /tmp/feature-breakdown.json + architecture docs

**Launch parallel spec-writer agents** (3-5 at a time):

For each feature in BATCH 1, launch a parallel Task:

Task(description="Generate spec for feature 001", subagent_type="planning:spec-writer", prompt="You are the spec-writer agent. Create complete specifications (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) for this feature.

Architecture Documentation (read directly from source):
@docs/architecture/frontend.md
@docs/architecture/backend.md
@docs/architecture/data.md
@docs/architecture/ai.md
@docs/architecture/infrastructure.md
@docs/architecture/security.md
@docs/architecture/integrations.md
@docs/adr/*.md
@docs/ROADMAP.md

Full Project Context:
$ARGUMENTS

Your Feature Assignment:
- Feature: Extract from JSON /tmp/feature-breakdown.json feature 001
- Phase: Extract phase from JSON (calculated from dependencies)
- Focus: Extract focus from JSON
- Dependencies: Extract dependencies from JSON
- Integrations: Extract integrations from JSON
- Shared Context: Extract sharedContext from JSON

Deliverable: Three files in phase-nested directory specs/phase-{phase}/F{number}-{name}/:
- spec.md (user requirements, tech-agnostic)
- plan.md (technical design with database schema, API contracts)
- tasks.md (implementation tasks, 5 phases, numbered)")

Task(description="Generate spec for feature 002", subagent_type="planning:spec-writer", prompt="You are the spec-writer agent. Create complete specifications (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) for this feature.

Full Project Context:
$ARGUMENTS

Your Feature Assignment:
- Feature: Extract from JSON /tmp/feature-breakdown.json feature 002
- Phase: Extract phase from JSON (calculated from dependencies)
- Focus: Extract focus from JSON
- Dependencies: Extract dependencies from JSON
- Integrations: Extract integrations from JSON

- spec.md (user requirements, tech-agnostic)
- plan.md (technical design with database schema, API contracts)
- tasks.md (implementation tasks, 5 phases, numbered)")

Continue launching Task() calls for ALL features in parallel (one Task per feature).

NOTE: In actual execution, the command orchestrator will read the JSON and dynamically create N Task() calls based on feature count.

Wait for ALL spec-writer agents to complete before proceeding.

Phase 6: Project Overview
Goal: Create high-level project overview with build phases and dependency graph

Actions:
- Create overview directory: !{bash mkdir -p specs/000-project-overview}
- Load template:
  - @~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dev-lifecycle-marketplace/plugins/planning/skills/spec-management/templates/project-overview-template.md
- Parse feature analysis JSON for:
  - Project name and description
  - All features with buildPhase, dependencies, sharedEntities
  - Shared context (tech stack, user types, data entities, entity ownership)
- Generate README.md with populated template:
  - **Features table** with build phase column, dependencies, status
  - **Tech stack** from sharedContext
  - **User types** from sharedContext
  - **Data Architecture** showing entity ownership (who owns what)
  - **Build Order & Phases** grouped by phase (1=Foundation, 2=Core, 3=Integration)
  - **Dependency graph** (mermaid) showing all feature relationships
  - **Critical path** (longest dependency chain)
  - **Parallel work opportunities** (which can build simultaneously)
  - **Integration map** (how features connect)
- Write: specs/000-project-overview/README.md
- This file provides the bird's-eye view of entire project with phase organization

Phase 7: Consolidation
Goal: Generate consolidated project-specs.json from all specs

Actions:
- Run consolidation script to generate JSON output
- Example: !{bash bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dev-lifecycle-marketplace/plugins/planning/skills/spec-management/scripts/consolidate-specs.sh}
- Verify JSON was created: !{bash test -f .planning/project-specs.json && echo "Generated" || echo "Missing"}
- Count total specs created across all phases: !{bash find specs/phase-* -name "spec.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l}

Phase 8: Summary
Goal: Provide comprehensive results with paths and next steps

Actions:
- Display feature count and spec locations by phase
- Show project-specs.json location
- List all phase directories and their contents:
  !{bash for phase in specs/phase-*; do echo "📁 $(basename $phase):"; ls -1 "$phase" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^/   /'; done}
- Display summary:
  - Total features analyzed
  - Features by phase: Phase 0: [X], Phase 1: [Y], Phase 2: [Z]...
  - Total specs created (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md per feature)
  - JSON consolidation location: .planning/project-specs.json
  - Next steps: Review specs, run /planning:validate-specs
