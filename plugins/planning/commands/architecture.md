🚨 **EXECUTION NOTICE FOR CLAUDE**

When you invoke this command via SlashCommand, the system returns THESE INSTRUCTIONS below.

**YOU are the executor. This is NOT an autonomous subprocess.**

- ✅ The phases below are YOUR execution checklist
- ✅ YOU must run each phase immediately using tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, TodoWrite)
- ✅ Complete ALL phases before considering this command done
- ❌ DON't wait for "the command to complete" - YOU complete it by executing the phases
- ❌ DON't treat this as status output - it IS your instruction set

**Immediately after SlashCommand returns, start executing Phase 0, then Phase 1, etc.**

See `@CLAUDE.md` section "SlashCommand Execution - YOU Are The Executor" for detailed explanation.

## Security Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All generated files must follow security rules:

@docs/security/SECURITY-RULES.md

**Key requirements:**
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use placeholders: `your_service_key_here`
- Protect `.env` files with `.gitignore`
- Create `.env.example` with placeholders only
- Document key acquisition for users

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

Goal: Design and document system architecture including component diagrams, data flows, infrastructure, and technical decisions

Core Principles:
- Framework-agnostic - works with any detected tech stack
- Comprehensive - covers all architectural aspects
- Visual - includes diagrams and flow charts
- Adaptable - aligns with detected stack from roadmap/project.json

## Available Skills

This commands has access to the following skills from the planning plugin:

- **architecture-patterns**: Architecture design templates, mermaid diagrams, documentation patterns, and validation tools. Use when designing system architecture, creating architecture documentation, generating mermaid diagrams, documenting component relationships, designing data flows, planning deployments, creating API architectures, or when user mentions architecture diagrams, system design, mermaid, architecture documentation, or component design.
- **decision-tracking**: Architecture Decision Records (ADR) templates, sequential numbering, decision documentation patterns, and decision history management. Use when creating ADRs, documenting architectural decisions, tracking decision rationale, managing decision lifecycle, superseding decisions, searching decision history, or when user mentions ADR, architecture decision, decision record, decision tracking, or decision documentation.
- **spec-management**: Templates, scripts, and examples for managing feature specifications in specs/ directory. Use when creating feature specs, listing specifications, validating spec completeness, updating spec status, searching spec content, organizing project requirements, tracking feature development, managing technical documentation, or when user mentions spec management, feature specifications, requirements docs, spec validation, or specification organization.

**To use a skill:**
```
!{skill skill-name}
```

Use skills when you need:
- Domain-specific templates and examples
- Validation scripts and automation
- Best practices and patterns
- Configuration generators

Skills provide pre-built resources to accelerate your work.

## Phase 1: Discovery

Goal: Understand the architecture request and current project state

Actions:
- Parse $ARGUMENTS for:
  - Action (design, update, diagram, review)
  - Architecture name (optional)
  - Flags: --sync-specs (auto-update affected specs after architecture changes)
- Load detected tech stack: @roadmap/project.json
- Check for existing architecture documentation
- Example: !{bash find docs -name "architecture*.md" 2>/dev/null}
- Identify architecture scope (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure, all)

## Phase 2: Analysis

Goal: Analyze project structure and determine architectural needs

Actions:
- Check for wizard requirements (if /planning:wizard was run):
  - Load: @docs/requirements/*/01-initial-request.md
  - Load: @docs/requirements/*/.wizard/extracted-requirements.json
  - Load: @docs/requirements/*/02-wizard-qa.md
  - These contain: project description, multimodal inputs, structured Q&A
- Review project structure and components
- Example: !{bash find . -type d -name "src" -o -name "app" -o -name "api" | head -10}
- Identify key architectural areas:
  - Frontend architecture (if detected)
  - Backend/API architecture (if detected)
  - Database schema and relationships
  - Infrastructure and deployment
  - Integration points
- Load any existing specs for context
- Example: @specs/*/README.md

## Phase 3: Planning

Goal: Outline architectural approach

Actions:
- If action unclear, use AskUserQuestion to ask:
  - What architectural aspect to focus on?
  - High-level or detailed design?
  - Any specific concerns (scalability, security, performance)?
- Determine documentation structure:
  - System overview
  - Component architecture
  - Data architecture
  - Infrastructure architecture
  - Security architecture
  - Integration architecture

## Phase 4: Implementation

Goal: Execute architecture design with agent

Actions:

Task(description="Design system architecture", subagent_type="planning:architecture-designer", prompt="You are the architecture-designer agent. Create system architecture for $ARGUMENTS.

Context:
- Detected tech stack: roadmap/project.json
- Wizard requirements (if available): docs/requirements/*/01-initial-request.md, docs/requirements/*/.wizard/extracted-requirements.json, docs/requirements/*/02-wizard-qa.md
- Action: $ARGUMENTS (design, update, diagram, review)

Requirements:
  - Read wizard requirements first (if they exist) to understand project goals
  - Create comprehensive architecture documentation including:
    - System overview and goals
    - Component diagrams
    - Data flow diagrams
    - Database schema design
    - API architecture
    - Infrastructure design
    - Security architecture
    - Deployment architecture
    - Integration patterns
  - Adapt to detected stack (Next.js, FastAPI, AI SDKs, etc.)
  - Use architecture-patterns skill templates

Deliverable: Complete architecture documentation with mermaid diagrams in docs/architecture/")

## Phase 5: Review

Goal: Verify architecture documentation

Actions:
- Check agent's output for completeness
- Verify architecture file created/updated
- Example: @docs/architecture/README.md
- Ensure all key areas covered:
  - Components ✓
  - Data flows ✓
  - Infrastructure ✓
  - Security ✓

## Phase 6: Documentation Sync & Impact Analysis

Goal: Register architecture changes and identify affected specs

Actions:
- If action was 'design' or 'update':
  - Sync architecture to Mem0 documentation registry:
    !{source /tmp/mem0-env/bin/activate && python plugins/planning/skills/doc-sync/scripts/sync-to-mem0.py --quiet 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Architecture registered in documentation system" || echo "⚠️  Doc sync unavailable (mem0 not installed)"}

  - Query which specs are affected by architecture changes:
    !{bash if [ -f /tmp/mem0-env/bin/activate ]; then source /tmp/mem0-env/bin/activate && python plugins/planning/skills/doc-sync/scripts/query-docs.py "What specs reference architecture documents?" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "Specification|references" | head -10 || echo "⚠️  No specs found referencing architecture"; fi}

  - Display affected specs for review
  - This identifies:
    - Which specs reference changed architecture docs
    - What features are impacted
    - Where implementation plans need review

  - If --sync-specs flag present:
    - Display: "🔄 Auto-updating affected specs based on architecture changes"
    - For each affected spec, invoke:
      SlashCommand(/planning:update-feature F00X "Updated to align with new architecture")
    - Display: "✅ All affected specs updated"

- If action was 'diagram' or 'review':
  - Skip sync (no changes made)

## Phase 7: Summary

Goal: Report architecture design results

Actions:
- Display summary:
  - "Architecture documented: docs/architecture/"
  - List main sections created
  - Highlight key architectural decisions
- Show next steps:
  - "Review architecture with team"
  - "Use /planning:decide to document key decisions as ADRs"
  - "Create specs based on architectural components"
  - "Use architecture to guide /iterate:tasks assignments"
