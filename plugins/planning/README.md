## 🚀 NEW: Intelligent Multi-Agent Spec Generation

### The Problem: Duplicate Tables & Wrong Build Order

When generating multiple feature specs in parallel **without coordination**, you get disasters:

❌ **Agent 1** creates `users` table in `001-exam-system`
❌ **Agent 2** creates `users` table in `002-voice-companion` (DUPLICATE!)
❌ **Agent 3** tries to build `003` before `001` exists (WRONG ORDER!)

### The Solution: Entity Ownership Tracking

Our system uses **intelligent dependency analysis** to prevent duplicates and ensure correct build order:

✅ **Agent 1** creates `users` table in `001-exam-system` (OWNS it)
✅ **Agent 2** references `users` via FK → `001.users.id` (no duplicate)
✅ **Build phases** ensure `001` completes before `002` starts

### How It Works

```
1. /planning:init-project "massive project description..."
   ↓
2. feature-analyzer agent breaks into features with dependencies
   ↓ (generates JSON with entity ownership)
   {
     "features": [
       {
         "number": "001",
         "buildPhase": 1,
         "sharedEntities": {
           "owns": ["User", "Exam"],
           "references": ["Trade"]
         }
       },
       {
         "number": "002",
         "buildPhase": 2,
         "sharedEntities": {
           "owns": ["VoiceSession"],
           "references": ["User", "Exam"]
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ↓
3. Spawn N parallel spec-writer agents (all at once)
   ↓
4. Each agent creates spec.md/plan.md/tasks.md
   - For OWNED entities → CREATE TABLE
   - For REFERENCED entities → FK only, NEVER recreate
   ↓
5. Generate 000-project-overview with build phases
   ↓
6. Consolidate to .planning/project-specs.json
```

### Build Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation** (build first)
- Features with no dependencies
- Own core data entities (User, Exam, Trade)
- Must complete before Phase 2

**Phase 2: Core** (build after Phase 1)
- Features that depend on Phase 1
- Reference Phase 1 entities via FK
- Cannot start until Phase 1 done

**Phase 3: Integration** (build last)
- Connect multiple Phase 1/2 features
- Final integration layer

### Example Output

```
specs/
├── 000-project-overview/
│   └── README.md (build phases, dependency graph, critical path)
├── 001-exam-system/        [Phase 1: OWNS User, Exam]
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── tasks.md
├── 002-voice-companion/    [Phase 2: REFERENCES User, Exam]
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── tasks.md
└── 003-trade-library/      [Phase 1: OWNS Trade]
    ├── spec.md
    ├── plan.md
    └── tasks.md
```

### New Commands

#### `/planning:init-project <project-description>`
**Create ALL specs in one shot from massive description**

Spawns N parallel agents, each creates spec/plan/tasks for one feature. Prevents duplicate tables with entity ownership tracking.

**Example:**
```bash
/planning:init-project "Red Seal AI: Exam prep platform with voice companion, mentorship, and payments. Tech stack: Next.js 15, FastAPI, Supabase."
```

#### `/planning:add-feature <feature-description>` ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Add feature with complete planning sync**

Intelligently adds features with similarity checking to prevent duplicates. Updates roadmap, creates ADRs, updates architecture docs automatically.

**Features:**
- ✅ Similarity checking (prevents duplicate specs)
- ✅ Updates ROADMAP.md automatically
- ✅ Creates ADRs for architecture decisions
- ✅ Updates architecture docs
- ✅ Keeps all planning in sync

**Example:**
```bash
/planning:add-feature "Employer portal for hiring apprentices"
→ Checks for similar existing specs
→ Asks priority, phase, dependencies
→ Updates roadmap automatically
→ Creates ADR if new tech/approach
```

#### `/planning:add-spec <feature-description>` ⚠️ DEPRECATED
**[DEPRECATED] Use `/planning:add-feature` instead**

This command is deprecated as of 2025-11-05. It created specs without similarity checking, leading to duplicates and out-of-sync planning docs.

**Migration:**
```bash
# Old (creates duplicates, no sync)
/planning:add-spec "email notifications"

# New (smart, prevents duplicates, full sync)
/planning:add-feature "email notifications"
```

#### `/planning:analyze-project`
**Analyze existing specs for completeness**

Spawns N parallel spec-analyzer agents, generates gap analysis.

**Example:**
```bash
/planning:analyze-project
```

### New Agents

#### `feature-analyzer`
Breaks massive project description into features with **entity ownership detection**. Assigns build phases (1=Foundation, 2=Core, 3=Integration). Outputs JSON with dependency graph.

#### `spec-writer` (enhanced)
Creates spec/plan/tasks for ONE feature. **Respects entity ownership boundaries** - never recreates tables owned by other specs. Uses FK for referenced entities.

#### `spec-analyzer`
Analyzes existing spec for completeness, quality issues, implementation gaps.

### Key Files

**Templates:**
